##Docker Compose Setup Instructions

##Running the application

* Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located.
* Run the command 'docker-compose up' to build and run the containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file. This command will download the necessary images and start the containers based on the configuration.
* If you want to run the process in the background, you can add the -d flag.
* After following the above steps, your application should be up and running, accessible at http://localhost:8080 or any other specified address in the 'docker-compose.yml' file.

##Stopping and Removing Containers

To stop and remove the containers from the running application, execute the following command in the terminal 'docker-compose down'.
