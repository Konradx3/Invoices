<h1>Docker Compose Setup Instructions</h1>

<h2>Running the application</h2>

- Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located.
- Run the command 'docker-compose up' to build and run the containers defined in the docker-compose.yml file. This command will download the necessary images and start the containers based on the configuration.
- If you want to run the process in the background, you can add the -d flag.
- After following the above steps, your application should be up and running, accessible at http://localhost:8080 or any other specified address in the 'docker-compose.yml' file.

<h2>Stopping and Removing Containers</h2>

To stop and remove the containers from the running application, execute the following command in the terminal 'docker-compose down
'.

<h3>Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine</h3>
